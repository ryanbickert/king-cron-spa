# King Cron

## Project Description:
Showcasing the power of modern web design, King Cron is a highly interactive, modular, PWA. It is responsive and downloadable on mobile and PC. The site overshadows template-based web design by providing a level of intrigue and originality that can't be replicated using other platforms.

King Cron features an animated, flippable Tome of Lore, a cute Character showcase, an interactable world map, a gameplay video, an entire embedded game, and live-tracked high scores. In a mere 24 days the site includes details like button hover effects, high score sorting options, custom icons, and SSL Certification on a live URL.

The site is an exhibition of Catalyst's strengths targeted at one of the largest industries imaginable. With a visually stunning frontend and highly configurable proof-of-concept backend, King Cron is the Catalyst ad you want to see.

The game was built using Unity, the most popular game engine, but the site's infrastructure is easily implementable with any game engine. The High Scores concept provides developers with an example of rapidly storing, retrieving, and displaying data. Applications of this example, with minimal changes, range from tracking player metrics to monetization strategies.
